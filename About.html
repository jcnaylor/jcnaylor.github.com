    <td width="415"><p>Julie Naylor is a Scientific Illustrator based out of Los Angeles. Since childhood, she has been fascinated with both nature and drawing. Growing up, weekends were spent in aquariums, museums, at the zoo, or out on hikes. When she was fifteen, she became a certified SCUBA diver, and this opened up a whole new world to her. For several years, she volunteered and worked for the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, further deepening these interests.</p>
    <p>In fall 2010, Julie was accepted to Cal State Monterey Bay's Scientific Illustration Program, and has found the experience life-changing. Through the program, Julie was able to learn various media and techniques. </p>
    <p>Julie loves illustrating various life forms, but has a special interest in the illustration of extinct species. She also loves depicting birds and marine life, but is interested in many different aspects of the natural world. </p></td>
